            "Excellence is a continuous process and not an accident"

        These words come from the man who knew excellence at close quarters, Late A.P.J Abdul Kalam. 
        The 11th President of India was a scientist turned politician who left a mark not just in Indian but also in the world history. 
        He has been honored with the Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian honor an Indian can receive. 
        He was elected the President unanimously by Bharatiya Janata Party and opposition Indian National Congress in the year 2002. 
        He served his term from 2002 to 2007 and then returned to his sacred life of education and science.

        Abdul Kalam had to struggle a lot to reach the success he has achieved in his career. 
        He has been a live manifestation of the strength he describes in this quote. 
        Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam or A.P.J Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October, 1931 to a humble Tamil Muslim family. 
        He had to sell newspapers his his childhood in order to manage the finances of the family. 
        He was an average student in school but his keen interest in studies and his hard work are what helped him achieve success in his career.
